My website gathered data. A LOT of data. I know people's information, not much (because I'm ethical) but enough for this project.

Here's a screen shot of what my database looks like, and it's just a sample:
![database]({{ site.url }}/images/screenshot/Screen Shot 2017-05-07 at 21.46.55.png)  
Each node is a different person, and within each node I have information about each person including their unique Facebook id, link to their Facebook profile, profile picture, cover photo, gender, age.  

I then made a template here:
![cash temaple]({{ site.url }}/images/cash-01.png)

Then ran data merge with the database with inDesign to automatically generate my money to be printed out here:
![printed money]({{ site.url }}/images/printed.jpg)


Now time to photograph it:  
Here's how I made it look like I have money flying everywhere:  
First, start I started with no money.
![start]({{ site.url }}/images/first.jpg)

Then I added more money. Each note is added independently.  
Here's the final image:
![finish]({{ site.url }}/images/final.jpg)
