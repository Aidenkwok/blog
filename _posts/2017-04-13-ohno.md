Here's what I originally had in mind:
![build 1]({{ site.url }}/images/screenshot/Screen Shot 2017-04-26 at 10.16.38.png)  

Now, in the graph explorer, it only allows me to do so much. There's something called 'public profile' and that's all the information I'm allowed to get before having to be authorised by Facebook themselves to get more. So Facebook want to keep data to themselves? I guess they just want to look like the good guys.

Originally I wanted things to be taken from the user news feed (in the background) and also number for friends, which is the value given to the note, as well as the location of the user.

Here's the error messages that showed:
![Error 1]({{ site.url }}/images/screenshot/Screen Shot 2017-04-27 at 13.45.58.png)

And here's the only data that i'm allowed before requesting for more:
![Error 2]({{ site.url }}/images/screenshot/Screen Shot 2017-04-27 at 13.46.22.png)
