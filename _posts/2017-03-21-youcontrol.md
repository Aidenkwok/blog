From the interviews conducted, it's not about the visual filters that people put over the images they post online, in fact, it's the step prior to it. The choosing, sorting and filtering on what is uploaded in the first place. Eg, you choose what to put up or not to put up; and generally it's the best of yourself. You wouldn't put something up that you wouldn't want someone else wouldn't see.

Personally, it applies to me too. I've not posted on instagram in well over 1 year with the reason being that I don't have anything to put up; meaning I don't want to or am not happy with what I have currently to share with other people.

From this comes test pieces i've created produced that present myself as an online character in which the user can customise and alter in order to control in a virtual world.
