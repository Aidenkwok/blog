Here’s a short summary of everything I’ve learnt so far:

Research never stops. Usually I think of research as separate to making, but in this project I’ve been researching and making at the same time. However, each time I research I’ve branched into a different, more specific part of my topic as mentioned in previous blog posts. This means at this stage, without having started making my final outcome, I still have things already made to represent my research along the way.

I set off with a goal in mind, and the question “why” wasn’t on my mind. This meant sometimes I didn’t know why I was researching, or why I was even doing what I was doing. Since each time my research kept taking me in different paths, I kept on loosing what my original proposal set out to do in the first place. Planning research is crucial. Eg, plan interviews, plan what kind of research, plan plan plan. Planning is not the same as not knowing what you’re doing. You might not have an idea what you want to create, but you can at least plan the research that will get you there.

Having said that, not knowing what you’re doing can be a good thing. I set out to look at digital culture as a whole, not knowing how big the subject was. After weeks of research, I’ve picked a smaller area of constructed identity online, specifically at selfies and self presentation and social media. I wouldn't have got to this place if I knew I was going in another direction.

What does this mean to me as a designer? Well, I definitely can’t solve the problem. It’s a complex and an issue that perhaps will never be resolved. But what I can do, is highlight the area of discussion. As a graphic designer, I can present the research I’ve done in a way that makes people shift their way of thinking and see a new perspective on what they’re doing in their own lives. I guess that’s my solution: not fixing the problem to fix the problem. 

So what happens next? I plan to continue to do more research, even when I head into the final parts of making. But making what? Something digital that manipulates reality, something that questions what is real and what is not.   And researching what? Just continuing to look deeper into the subject, and perhaps I might find something that will continue to shift where this project is going.
