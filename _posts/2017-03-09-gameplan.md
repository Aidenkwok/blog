summary:    the plan for the project

Instead to doing all my reserach in one go, the proceed to making afterwards (like how i'd usually do), I've decided to reserach and make throughout the whole project.

Since the project, has the potential to become a research project, I will reserach throughout the whole time and also make alongside.

Here's what will happen:
1. I will research for 1 week and then respond by making,
2. Whatever's I've made with be reactived to,
3. The reaction will lead on to more research and they whole cycle will repeat (not sure how many times yet)
4. at the end of the project, I will collate and archive all my research findings and made pieces and that itself will be my resolved piece.

Ideas of archives could be a book, website, or box, or series of posters?

Since I have the idea to carry out various different methods of research, I can break it down and organise it so that I carry out a different method each week and spread it out for the duration of the project with 1 finidng leading to what I will do next.

This week I will be looking at secondary research;
1. academic writtings  
2. talks
3. blogs
4. books
