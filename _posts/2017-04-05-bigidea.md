Here's the idea:
I use the existing structures that already exist in order to expose how bad it is with facebook getting our data.

I'm going to create an app to harvest people's data and gather them into a data and turn it into fake money. The Facebook API should be able to allow me to grab data and then I can feed it into a template where it will automatically generate money and hopefully, also print it if there's time.

**What do I need?**  
A database (Firebase)  
A template  (HTML + CSS)  
Functionality (A whole load of Javascript)

**Do I know what I'm doing?**  
Absolutely not. but I have 4 weeks to work out and learn everything... hopefully
