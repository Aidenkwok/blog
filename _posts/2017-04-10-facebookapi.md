What the Facebook API is, it's like Facebook passes data onto you to use on your site. So it's "useful" for app developers to do things like sign in with Facebook making it "easier" to get the necessary data to quickly make and account for example.

However, I'm sure Facebook will have some other things attached to the scripts to allow Facebook to monitor other things whilst on your site.


Here's some basic info that Facebook can get:

And here's some more data Facebook has with the right permissions:

If I can get people to login onto my website, I can use the information the graph explorer gives me to put the information onto the bank note.
