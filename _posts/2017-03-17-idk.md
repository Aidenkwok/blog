Top tip: you can’t do all your research all at once  
Another top tip: plan everything ahead of time

As in previous [here]({% post_url 2017-03-09-gameplan %}) I’ve decided to cut down my research into 3 parts. First being secondary research, being informed by the studies that already exist including academic writings, blogs, and videos. The research pointed toward social media and its effects on people (especially those who are younger) which produced a poster at the end of it. [here]({% post_url 2017-03-14-poster1 %}).

The second part of research (current stage) will be face to face interviews, reason being that interviews requires some form of knowledge to be successful in active discussion of the research topic. Again, this part of research will produce some sort of making a result. This part will be focused upon the culture of filters and hyper-reality of social media, gathering unique stories based upon previous findings.

The 3rd part will then be based upon what I’ve found this week (up till Tuesday) and then moving onto a commentary and solution of what I’ve found. Again, through making of some sort. Then the final week will then a purely making, making each part of the research to collate and form a final piece; perhaps an archive, but is subject to change at this stage. 

In terms of reflection in this project, it seems that a designer is often busy with other projects. They can never do as much as they think they can. I don’t think a designer, most of the time, can become an expert in topic they are communicating but they need to try and come close. 

I think that’s why designers typically communicate other people’s ideas (Clients). They team up with the people that know the subject best and filter out what is relevant to present. But in the case of an independent project, the designer is the client. Then what? The designer (me in this case) can’t possibly comment on a such a big topic since there is so many different viewpoints, opinions, studies, and endless amounts of research. 

If I want to become an expert, I’ll need to choose a very specific area, and communicate that area, as an expert. 

See my visual for clarification.
