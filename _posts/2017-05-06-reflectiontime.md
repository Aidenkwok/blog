Again, here's the final website:  
[Make Money!](https://www.aidenkwok.co.uk/makemoney/)

**What does this project mean for me?**  
As a design who works on [Co & Co](https://coandco.io), it's important to take the lessons I've learnt with this project. I'm going to be handling a lot of data and I'll be able to see everything, and I'm not sure if seeing everything is ethical in the first place.

Perhaps I don't even need to create the systems to begin with in the first place. I can use what's already out there to create a message using my digital skills.

**What about the process?**  
I'm not too sure about working within a blog. It's good to keep track of things on a week to week basis, but it's hard to see the body of work at the end. It's hard to compare week to week and see what you have at the end.

However, constantly doing research throughout the whole process allowed me to take different directions and explore different ideas making it feel fresh each week.

At least at the end, I know what I want to do as a designer and I know what direction I want to head in.
