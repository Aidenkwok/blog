**Things to look at:**
 
[Rachel Maclean](http://www.rachelmaclean.com)  
[Cindy Sharman](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/cindy-sherman-1938)  
Self portraiture as a whole; how we use self portrait as a medium to communicate,  
ways we take images of ourselves

**Things to look think about:**  

-recreating the organic side of identity,  
-the purpose of the project,  
-standard asthetics of social media,  
-defining different filters and perhaps creating my own filter,  
-how does this effect our ways of living and interactions?  
-speaking to people who are against social media,  
-subverting something,looking at the structure closely and delivering and observation about it,  
-the structure of social media, can we really control it?
