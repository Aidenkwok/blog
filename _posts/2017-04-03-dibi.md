I don't usually get excited, but this must be way beyond 'excited'. I was at fan-girl stage when I was listening to Lauren Kalbag's talk at DiBi. She was talking about being ethical when it comes to design.

Basically, long story short, free services like Facebook and Google make money by selling on unidentifiable data. Then other companies use other databases to turn that data into identifiable data, basically meaning people can buy information about you.

Think about how much Facebook knows, probably even more than your best friend. It knows your face, your name, what things you like, what things make you happy, where you live, how often you check your phone, etc. In fact, some websites with trackers will link back to Facebook to feed data. So when you think you're not on Facebook, Facebook still knows.

So as a designer who wants to work in this digital space, it's important for me, when it comes to designing to design ethical alternatives, or be ethical to being with. To respect people's data and not to sell it on to make money.
