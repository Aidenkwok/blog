On Thursday the 30th March, I decided to go to a design conference for designers and developers without the intention of using any of it as part of my independent project. However, on the Friday, Lauren Kalbag, an ethical designer, gave a talk about internet privacy and ethical design. Surprisingly it was very relevant to my personal project and inspired me to consider an area I’m passionate about, but also an area not widely talked about.

If I didn’t go to “Design it, build it”, I think my project would be the same as every other student project about social media. Why? Because everyone does the same research and everyone does the same thing. But I decided to get out the studio and go to a different talk, different person, and different source, meaning my research isn’t the same as everyone else’s research. My project becomes unique because I have research no one else has.

I guess that’s the point I’m making with this blog post. If you stay within the studio and do your own research, the chances of you finding something original are slimmer than if you went out, shared your research and go to different places. The people you speak to not only point you, but even accelerate you in different directions you’d have never thought of.

That doesn’t mean that you don’t ever go into the studio. I think it’s important that you do your own research, test the waters, and see what’s already out there. Form an opinion and then share that with people and see what they think. Talk to people about what they’ve done and the issues they’re trying to tackle. You need to be in the studio for you do get out in the first place.

In fact, I felt so inspired speaking to Lauren after her talk, that I think I know which direction I want to go as a designer. Maybe getting out the studio was the best thing that happened to this project.
