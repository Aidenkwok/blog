Why am I doing this project? As a designer who intends to work digitally, I need to question the impact of what I do and not just the work itself. Doing this will provide an ethical guideline as a designer rather than taking any jobs that come my way. The research produced from the project will give a foundation of knowledge on the impact of digital culture, specifically relating to ease of access to services, toward human interaction through instant gratification. 

But why now? now I have access to both a generation who were introduced into digital culture in its beginning but also a generation who are born into a digital, on-demand, environment. In the future, there will only be a generation, or generations who have always known the culture that we have.

So how? Currently I have a broad question: “how does digital culture impact human interaction?” and therefore plan to narrow my research down specifically to an area of human interaction; perhaps friendship. Secondly I will carry out interviews, with how people interact with their friends, from 2 age ranges; 18-35 and 35-50+.

Why might this be relevant? I expect the results to show me that with social media, the invention of the smartphone, creation of internet services etc, would lead to people either:

1) having increased communication with their friends, with stronger friendships
2) having less communication with their friends, with weaker friendships

If my research shows that there is a negative impact on human interaction due to the raise of digital culture, then as a designer who aims to work in this area, what must I do to ensure that I don’t allow my work to impact people in a negative way? How do I promote positive change digitally?
